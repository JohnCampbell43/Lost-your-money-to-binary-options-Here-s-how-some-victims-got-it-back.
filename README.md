Lost your money to binary options? Here’s how some victims got it back.
Felicia's story is a fortunate one, but it highlights a troubling reality for many who fall victim to binary options scams. After investing over $100,000 into what appeared to be a legitimate trading platform, she found herself unable to withdraw her funds, including any supposed profits. Her son, who had used her credit card for the investment, unwittingly became embroiled in a scam perpetrated by one of the numerous fraudulent binary options firms based in Israel. Unfortunately, Felicia’s experience is not unique, as many binary options customers lose their money, often without any recourse.
